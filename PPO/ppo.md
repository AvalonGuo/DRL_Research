# Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)
## Reinforcement Learning(RL)
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions in the environment and receives rewards as feedback. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. By exploring different actions and receiving rewards, the agent learns to make better decisions and improve its performance in the environment. RL is widely used in various applications such as game playing, robot control, and autonomous driving.
